# APPLE_2024 Project

This project contains 3 Jupyter Notebook programs: `Gnews.ipynb`, `Experience.ipynb`, and `Trading.ipynb`, along with related data files and trading charts.

## File Descriptions

### Data Files
- **APPLE.json**: Contains historical news data used for experience learning.
- **APPLE_Trading.json**: Contains news data used for the live trading phase.
- **APPLE_EXP.json**: Stores the trading experience learned from the historical news data in a standardized format.
- **APPLE.xlsx**: Contains historical stock price data of Apple Inc.

### Code Files
- **Gnews.ipynb**:
  - Downloads news related to Apple Inc. from the Gnews API.
  - The news data is saved into two files:
    - `APPLE.json`: Stores news data for the experience learning phase.
    - `APPLE_Trading.json`: Stores news data for the live trading phase.

- **Experience.ipynb**:
  - Learns trading experience from the historical news data in `APPLE.json`.
  - Explains the reasons for stock price movements based on the news of the day and saves the results in `APPLE_EXP.json`.

- **Trading.ipynb**:
  - Simulates human-like trading behavior based on news and experience data.
  - Uses both the news dataset (`APPLE.json`) and the experience dataset (`APPLE_EXP.json`) to simulate 3 trading models: **Radical** , **Conservative**, and **Normal**.
  - The trading records for each model are saved as:
    - `responses_by_date_conservative.txt`: Trading records for the conservative model.
    - `responses_by_date_normal.txt`: Trading records for the normal model.
    - `responses_by_date_radical.txt`: Trading records for the radical model.
  - The corresponding trading charts are saved as:
    - `stock_actions_conservative.png`: Trading chart for the conservative model.
    - `stock_actions_normal.png`: Trading chart for the normal model.
    - `stock_actions_radical.png`: Trading chart for the radical model.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Download News Data**(The news had been collected):
   - Run `Gnews.ipynb` to download news related to Apple Inc. from the Gnews API.
   - The news data will be saved in `APPLE.json` (for experience learning) and `APPLE_Trading.json` (for live trading).

2. **Learn Trading Experience**:
   - Run `Experience.ipynb` to learn trading experience from the historical news data in `APPLE.json`.
   - The results will be saved in `APPLE_EXP.json` for use in the trading simulation.

3. **Simulate Trading**:
   - Run `Trading.ipynb` to simulate trading behavior using both the historical news data (`APPLE.json`) and the experience data (`APPLE_EXP.json`).
   - Choose between different trading models (Conservative, Normal, Radical) and generate the respective trading records and charts.

## Trading Models and Results

- **Conservative**:
  - Trading records: `responses_by_date_conservative.txt`
  - Chart: `stock_actions_conservative.png`

- **Normal**:
  - Trading records: `responses_by_date_normal.txt`
  - Chart: `stock_actions_normal.png`

- **Radical**:
  - Trading records: `responses_by_date_radical.txt`
  - Chart: `stock_actions_radical.png`
